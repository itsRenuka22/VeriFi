# Fraud_Detection

Real-time fraud detection system built using Redis and Kafka for high-speed event streaming and in-memory analysis. Deployed on AWS using Docker and Kubernetes for scalability and fault tolerance, enabling instant anomaly detection and automated risk alerts across transactions.

## 🖥️ Analyst Console (React)

A complementary analyst UI lives in `../frontend/`. It visualises live KPIs, recent decisions, alerts, and transactions using the running backend services.

```bash
# in a separate terminal
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). Backend endpoints are proxied to:
- `http://localhost:8082` (`fraud-service` REST APIs)
- `http://localhost:8080` (`ingest-api` for transaction submissions)

Override with `VITE_API_BASE` / `VITE_INGEST_BASE` environment variables if your services run elsewhere.

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

Component | Description
---|---
Ingest API | Receives incoming transactions → validates → pushes JSON into Kafka (`payments.events`).
Fraud Service | Consumes `payments.events` → applies rules & Redis-based context checks → publishes decisions to `fraud.decisions` → saves to Postgres.
Kafka | Message backbone connecting microservices.
Redis | Fast in-memory store for user/device state and recent-activity windows.
PostgreSQL | Persists all fraud-decision records for audit & analytics.
Docker Compose | Spins up Kafka + Redis + Postgres locally with isolated ports.

## 🧩 Fraud-Scoring Logic

Every transaction is given a risk score (0–100).
Final decision thresholds:

Score Range | Decision | Description
---|---|---
0–29 | ALLOW | Normal behaviour.
30–59 | REVIEW | Borderline / needs manual check.
60+ | BLOCK | High risk fraud pattern.

### 🔍 Rules (Score Contributors)

Rule | Condition | Score Impact | Reason Tag
---|---:|---:|---
High Amount | amount ≥ 1000 | +60 | high_amount
Invalid Amount | ≤ 0 | +100 | invalid_amount
Bad Currency | currency missing or invalid | +40 | bad_currency
Night Time | hour 00 – 05 UTC | +20 | night_time
Burst | ≥ 3 tx within 60 s (configurable) | +40 | burst_60s
**Spend Spike** | **amount ≥ 5× user's median** | **+30** | **spend_spike**
New Device | first-seen within 7 days (configurable) | +20 | new_device
New IP | first-seen within 7 days (configurable) | +15 | new_ip
Geo-Impossible | Travel speed > 900 km/h (configurable) | +50 | geo_impossible

Total score = sum of triggered rule points (clamped to 100).

**🎛️ Configurable Thresholds:** All fraud rules are now configurable via `application.properties` - no code changes needed to adjust sensitivity!

## ⚙️ Configuring Fraud Rules

All fraud detection thresholds can be tuned in `services/fraud-service/src/main/resources/application.properties`:

```properties
# Burst detection
app.rules.burst.windowSec=60      # Time window in seconds
app.rules.burst.count=3           # Max transactions allowed
app.rules.burst.score=40          # Score penalty

# Spend spike detection
app.rules.spend.multiplier=5.0    # Alert if ≥ 5× user's median
app.rules.spend.score=30
app.rules.spend.historySize=10    # Track last N transactions

# Device/IP freshness
app.rules.device.newWithinDays=7  # Treat as "new" for 7 days
app.rules.device.score=20
app.rules.ip.newWithinDays=7
app.rules.ip.score=15

# Geo-impossibility
app.rules.geo.maxSpeedKmph=900    # Speed threshold
app.rules.geo.score=50
```

**To adjust:** Edit values → Restart fraud-service → Changes apply immediately!

## 🆕 What's New

**Configurable Fraud Rules:**
- All thresholds now configurable in `application.properties`
- No code changes needed to adjust fraud sensitivity
- Quick iteration: edit config → restart → done!

**Spend Spike Detection:**
- Tracks user's spending history (last 10 transactions)
- Calculates median spending pattern
- Flags transactions ≥ 5× normal spending as suspicious
- Example: User normally spends $30, suddenly $200 → Flagged!

**Smart Device/IP Trust:**
- Devices/IPs are "new" only for first 7 days
- After 7 days, they become "trusted"
- Reduces false positives for regular users
